There some few things that I want to upgrade their value

first, as you know, this app is still using local storage, so I hope in the future I can make it with online database so people can comehere with their account and their data still attached
second, mainly because this is just some fun project I'm really sorry if the css style is really ugly-looking xD
third, If someone have idea, trick, or feedback especially on how to manage user and save their data, and as you notice there are still some few uncomfortable things in here like we have to refresh again the page after the prompt to make the welcome page to appear


See you again,
